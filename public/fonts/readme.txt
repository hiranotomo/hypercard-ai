Classic Mac Fonts

To complete the authentic HyperCard experience, you need to add classic Mac fonts:

1. Chicago font - The classic Mac system font
2. Geneva font - Used for text fields

You can find web font versions of these classic Mac fonts from various sources.
Place the .woff2 files in this directory.

For the authentic experience, consider using bitmap/pixel fonts that match 
the original Mac aesthetics from 1984-1995.
